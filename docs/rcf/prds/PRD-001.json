  "productName": "Universal Adaptive Testing Platform",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "status": "draft",
  "executiveSummary": "A configurable, extensible adaptive testing engine supporting multiple exam methodologies (CAT, LOFT, Linear) with AI-augmented content authoring and smart analytics. The platform treats exam rules, stopping criteria, and scoring algorithms as configurable metadata rather than hard-coded logic.",
  "problemStatement": "Current adaptive testing platforms are typically hard-coded for specific exam types (e.g., NCLEX, GMAT), making it costly and time-consuming to adapt them for new domains or methodologies. Organizations need a flexible, extensible platform that can support multiple exam types, scoring models, and content domains without requiring core engine modifications.",
  "targetUsers": [
    "Test Administrators - Configure exam profiles, manage question banks, and monitor test delivery",
    "Content Authors - Create, review, and manage question content across multiple domains",
    "Test Takers - Students and professionals taking adaptive exams for certification or assessment",
    "Psychometricians - Analyze test performance, calibrate items, and validate scoring models",
    "System Integrators - Integrate the platform with external LMS and credential systems"
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "Enable support for multiple exam methodologies (CAT, LOFT, Linear, Section-Adaptive) through a single configurable engine",
    "Reduce time-to-market for new exam types by 80% through pluggable strategy architecture",
    "Achieve sub-200ms next-item latency for optimal test-taker experience",
    "Provide AI-augmented content authoring to accelerate question bank development",
    "Deliver actionable analytics through Smart Coach to improve learner outcomes"
  ],
  "inScope": [
    "Polymorphic exam engine with configurable algorithms and stopping rules",
    "Universal question bank supporting multiple item types and domains",
    "AI-augmented content authoring with human-in-the-loop validation",
    "Smart Coach analytics including gap analysis and adaptive remediation",
    "Session state management with resume capability",
    "Item exposure control and anti-harvesting protection",
    "Audit logging and ACID-compliant data storage",
    "Student Progress Dashboard with post-exam analytics and performance insights",
    "Topic-based learning path with targeted practice exams",
    "Intelligent exam scheduling based on study time and topic coverage",
    "Admin Dashboard for question bank and content management"
  ],
  "outOfScope": [
    "Proctoring and identity verification services (third-party integration only)",
    "Mobile native applications (web-responsive design only for MVP)",
    "Real-time video-based cheating detection",
    "Integration with specific LMS platforms (API-first approach for future integrations)",
    "Psychometric research and item calibration studies (platform supports data export)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)",
    "Must support PostgreSQL as the primary database for ACID compliance",
    "Scoring Service must be implemented in Python for statistical library support",
    "Must operate in cloud-agnostic containerized environment (Docker/Kubernetes)",
    "API response times must meet P95 < 200ms SLA for adaptive item selection"
